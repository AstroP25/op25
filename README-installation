How to Install OP25
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These high level instructions will lead you through installing op25
on Debian based Linux systems such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint and similar.

Note 1: op25 is currently tested against gnuradio-3.7 and python2.  The code
is written to be largely python-version agnostic but there are elements of
the build process (e.g. swig scripts) that may rely on python2.  Patches
for gnuradio-3.8 are included for those wishing to experiment, but at this
point they are not tested and may not function as intended.

Note 2: versions of cmake later than 3.10.3 have been known to cause dependency
issues while building the swig libraries. At the current time if you experience
build difficulties of this sort, try dropping back to cmake-3.10.3, delete the
contents of ~/op25/build/ and start over.

Note 3: There is also a ./rebuild.sh script that will (optionally) update & rebuild op25, local changes must be committed or reverted for update to happen.
