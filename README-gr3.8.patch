The op25 install.sh script attempts to determine whether you are
building for gnuradio-3.7 with python2 or gnuradio-3.8 with python3

Rather than branching the repo source tree, and until such time as 
gnuradio3.8 should become standard, it was decided to distribute 
the necessary mods to build OP25 for gnuradio3.8 / python3 in
the form of a patch file gr3.8.patch

When you run the install.sh script the patch will be applied
automatically if needed.  Re-running the install.sh script will
result in warning messages that patches are being skipped.  These
may be safely ignored.
