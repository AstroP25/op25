The git branch "gr310" is only designed for building on gnuradio-3.10 and above.  If you are trying to
build on a gnuradio-3.8 or prior system please "git checkout master" (head).  Note that gnuradio-3.9
was a transitional release and support is untested on this version of op25.

If you are building op25 on a standard packaged Debian-derivative OS (e.g. Ubuntu 22, Linux Mint 21,
Debian Bookworm) you should be able to git clone the repo, check out the gr310 branch and execute "install.sh"
to build and install the app and libraries with minimal pain.

If you plan on building op25 with a locally built & installed gnuradio (i.e. something other
than an apt packaged version) you cannot run install.sh.  Under these circumstances you have to make
sure all dependencies are installed then perform the following steps:
	cd ~/op25
	mkdir build

	cd build
	cmake ../

	make
	make install

The git repo contains all op25 sources and python<->c++ binding code generated by pybind11.  Unless you are
changing interfaces, you should not need to recreate the bindings.
NOTE that op25 and gnuradio MUST be compiled with the same version of compiler, which normally means the default
supplied with your distro.  Attempting to mix compilers will be an exercise in frustration...
