The git branch "gr310" is only designed for building on gnuradio-3.10 and above.  If you are trying to
build on a gnuradio-3.8 or prior system please "git checkout master" (head).  Note that gnuradio-3.9
was a transitional release and support is untested on this version of op25.

If you are building op25 on a standard packaged long term supported OS with gcc-11 (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04)
you should be able to git clone the repo, check out the gr310 branch and execute "install.sh" to build
and install the app and libraries with minimal pain.

Building op25 on short term testing releases containing all the latest component variations including
gcc-12 (e.g. Ubuntu 22.10, Debian Bookworm) will likely be an exercise in frustration as you encounter
fatal errors due to differences in g++ compiler flags between gcc-11 and gcc-12. While there are hacks
that can be made to the installed gnuradio code to work around this, my recommendation would be to drop
back to a supported release and wait for fixes to catch up.

Lastly, if you plan on building op25 with a locally built & installed gnuradio (i.e. something other
than an apt packaged version) you cannot run install.sh.  Under these circumstances you have to make
sure all dependencies are installed then perform the following steps:
	cd ~/op25
	mkdir build

	./build_bindings.sh

	cd build
	cmake ../

	make
	make install
If the bindings fail to build properly this will lead to further errors (missing files) during cmake.
